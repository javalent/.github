# Governance Guidelines

Welcome to our GitHub organization! These are the basic governance guidelines that outline how our community operates.

## Purpose

Our organization is dedicated to developing and maintaining open-source projects for Obsidian with a TTRPG focus. We aim to foster an inclusive and collaborative environment for developers worldwide.

## Decision-Making Process

### Project Maintainers

Each project within the organization has one or more maintainers who have the final authority over their respective projects. They are responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests and setting the project's technical direction.

### Repository Governance

For decisions affecting the entire organization or multiple projects, we follow a collaborative process:

1. **Proposal:** Anyone can propose a major decision by opening an issue in the main repository.

2. **Discussion:** The community and relevant stakeholders engage in a discussion on the issue.

3. **Consensus Building:** The proposal remains open for a reasonable period to allow for feedback and consensus building.

4. **Decision Making:** If there is clear consensus and no significant objections, the proposal can be accepted and implemented. Otherwise, a final decision is made by the project maintainers.

### Emergency Decisions

In urgent cases, maintainers may make temporary decisions. These decisions should be documented and communicated to the community.
